# local-llms-analyse-finance
In this project, I explored how local LLMs can be used to label data and support analyses.
Specifically, I used Llama2 model to automatically categorise my bank transaction data.

## Installing local LLMs with Ollama (currently support MacOS and Linux)
See [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) documentation on how to install for your operating system.

## Extending a model via Ollama model file
This command is used to create a customized model from one of the already supported ones.
```shell
ollama create <model_name> -f <model_file>
```
